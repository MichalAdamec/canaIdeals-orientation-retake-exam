Write queries that:

1)Select name and preferences of applicants under age of 30 from Hungary (using name of the country within query, and not the country_id value)

SELECT name, preference FROM myowndatabase.applicants join myowndatabase.countries on myowndatabase.applicants.country_id = myowndatabase.countries.id where country='Hungary' and age<30;



2)Since we won't be offering Python courses in Hungary anymore, update preference of all hungarian applicants to Unknown (you can use explicit country_id value here)

update myowndatabase.applicants set preference='unknown' where applicants.country_id=2;



3)Show average age of Czech and Hungarian applicants such as:

select country, avg(age) as average_age from myowndatabase.applicants join myowndatabase.countries on applicants.country_id = countries.id group by country;
